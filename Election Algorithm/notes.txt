Election Algorithms: 

Election algorithms choose a process from a group of processors to act as a coordinator. If the coordinator process crashes due to some reasons, then a
new coordinator is elected on other processor. Election algorithm basically determines where a new copy of the coordinator should be restarted. Election algorithm 
assumes that every active process in the system has a unique priority number. The process with highest priority will be chosen as a new coordinator. Hence, when
a coordinator fails, this algorithm elects that active process which has highest priority number.Then this number is send to every active process in the 
distributed system. We have two election algorithms for two different configurations of a distributed system. 

The Bully Algorithm : 
    This algorithm applies to system where every process can send a message to every other process in the system.
    
The Ring Algorithm :
    This algorithm applies to systems organized as a ring(logically or physically). In this algorithm we assume that the link between the process are unidirectional 
    and every process can message to the process on its right only. Data structure that this algorithm uses is active list, a list that has a priority number of all 
    active processes in the system.
